To run

-npm run dev

To test

-npm run test

If I had more time:

- More tests, test each deviceDetails section individually (summary, status etc) as well as test the response of when the fetch call fails
- Some data needs formattinG, mainly Dates
- CSS/styling, as this is a tech test styling this has been the least prioritised and hence leaves a lot to be desired compared to a production app
